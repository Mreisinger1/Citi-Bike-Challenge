# Citi-Bike-Challenge

Analysis: 

Phenomena 1: There are more male than female Citi Bike users, but Female users have longer trips on average. There are also more male than female Citi Bike Subscribers and Customers. 

Phenomena 2: The top stations to start and end a Citi Bike trip are very similar, and they are distributed throughout the main area of the city. The bikes that are used the most in these top stations are the most likely to need maintenance and repair. 

Map Analysis: 

The most used stations are centered more in the middle of the city, near the busiest areas. While the least used stations are spread out more in the outer area of the city, where less people are around daily.

Directions for project: 

Congratulations on your new job! As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike Program, you are now responsible for overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. In your new role, you will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.
Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.
However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

Your final submission should include:

A link to your Tableau Public workbook that includes the following:

4â€“10 total "phenomenon" visualizations
2 dashboards
1 city official map
1 story
A text or markdown file with your analysis of the phenomena you uncovered in the data.
